Very basic user login and registration system using Laravel php, xampp with phpMyAdmin for the database and React for the frontend.

This is a small part of a project that I started in my Software engineering class. I used my previous React js code and integrated it into a new Laravel project. The database is hosted locally using xampp(MySql) and React is run on the apache server also through xampp. 

User autentication is implemented using Laravel sanctum. I had to implement this to display the user profile page and also to allow the user to change their password and email address. The passwords are automatically encrypted with laravel since I used it's default database setup. 

React and it's various libraries were used for components and css formatting, as well as the icons. 

Only the main files are included. Please see the screenshots to see the UI and login/registration actions.
